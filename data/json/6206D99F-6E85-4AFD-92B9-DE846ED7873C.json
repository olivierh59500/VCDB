As a result, some Marin doctors were unable to access their patients' medical records for more than a week.  information includes vital signs, limited clinical history, documentation of physical examinations, and any record of the communication between patients and their physician during a visit in that 15 day period.  Although no financial or personal patient information was found to be compromised, one of the company's backup systems failed during the data-restoration process; the data loss occurred at the time of the system restore due to a faulty backup system  not due to the malware",
