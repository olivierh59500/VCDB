  "summary": "In December 2015, a journalist disclosed one patient's health data in a TV show. The data were related to the patient's mental health and his treatment in the mental health clinic \"Dr Laza Lazarevic\", in Belgrade. The Serbian Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection (\"Commissioner\") promptly established that the clinic disclosed the data to the Ministry of Health which, in turn, made the data available to the Ministry of Interior. On 23 December 2015, the Commissioner issued a warning to the clinic and the Ministry of Health because of the blatant violation of the patient's right to privacy and protection of personal data. The Commissioner did not establish who disclosed the data to the journalist.",
