  "summary": "The Ottawa Hospital has confirmed that four computers in its network of 9,800 were hit with ransomware last week which encrypted the information on those machines making it unaccessible to hospital administrators.  \"No patient information was affected. The malware locked down the files and the hospital responded by wiping the drives,\" said Kate Eggins a spokeswoman for the hospital. \"We are confident we have appropriate safeguards in place to protect patient information and continue to look for ways to increase security. We would like to reiterate that no patient information was obtained through the attempt.\"",
