In the letter, the clinic said a thief hacked into its patient database on September 22, gaining access to names, Social Security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, and patient records.  We regret to inform you that on September 22, 2016 we confirmed an unauthorized intrusion into our computer system. We took immediate action and are working closely with forensic experts and the FBI to investigate and address the situation.  While our investigation is ongoing, we have found evidence indicating that information such as patient names, home addresses, email addresses, and dates of birth was potentially taken. In some cases the patient's treatment code, prescription records, or social security number may also have been taken. ",
