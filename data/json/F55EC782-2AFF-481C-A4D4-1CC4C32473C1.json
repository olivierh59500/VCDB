  "summary": "Confetti rained down on the U.S. Women's soccer team. The parade in New York City celebrated their world cup win.  Ticker-tape parade for U.S. women's World Cup champs  This is what caught 2 Wants To Know's attention, a reporter tweeted out a picture of strips of confetti that make up entire prescriptions. Patient names, doctor office address. Why were medical records part of the confetti?  2 Wants To Know organizes the Shred-A-Thons every year. How could the city would allow personal info to be out on the street with confetti they provided.  It's not unheard of, in 2012 the CBS station in New York reported confetti dropped from office buildings during the New York Giants SUper Bowl parade included Social Security numbers and medical treatment records.  Later that same year, police department reports and documents ended up as confetti during the Thanksgiving Day parade, but the official confetti was just colored paper.  It seems this is the case, again, of official versus local businesses and residents confetti. The official confetti of this parade was supplied by the Atlas Packaging Company, two tons of strip cut, blank, news roll. ",
