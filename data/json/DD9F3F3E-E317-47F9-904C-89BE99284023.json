The breach took place when a member of staff took home an unencrypted work laptop, which was stolen during a burglary. The laptop contained sensitive personal information relating to 46 staff, including reasons for sickness absence and information about disciplinary matters. It also contained sensitive personal information about 29 residents, including their dates of birth, mental and physical health and 'do not resuscitate' status.",
