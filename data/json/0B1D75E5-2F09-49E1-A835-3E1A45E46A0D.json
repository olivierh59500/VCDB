  "summary": "On June 27, 2016 we learned that contact sheets, which are documents kept in a system used for sales purposes, had been accessed and possibly viewed for unauthorized purposes. We immediately began an investigation and brought in outside experts. We determined the unauthorized access occurred between March and June of 2016. While there is no indication that the information in this system has been used fraudulently, we needed to let you know that your information was in this system.  The information on the contact sheets that were exposed included name, address, and phone number. For some people it also included date of birth and limited health notes, such as a doctor name, health condition, or medication name. For a small number of individuals it may have also included Social Security number.",
